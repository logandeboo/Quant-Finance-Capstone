This study utilizes finBERT, a financially augmented version of Google’s BERT large language
model, to quantify the relationship between managerial sentiment and future volatility and return
across current S&P-500 companies. Managerial sentiment was found to be a significant and
negative predictor of return and volatility over time periods between ten days and one year,
inclusively. The relationship between sentiment and volatility, however, was found to be
considerably stronger than that of sentiment and return. Moreover, an index of monthly returns
was created using our proposed sentiment factor to assess cumulative performance. Lastly,
monthly returns from this index were Pearson correlated with factor returns from Fama and
French’s (1992) three factor model. We found our sentiment factor to be correlated with the SMB
(small minus big) factor at -35% which was intuitive due to our universe of large-cap S&P-500
companies. Lastly, our factor returns were correlated with the HML (high minus low) factor at
-6% which reflects our factor may have the potential to capture additional risk elements.
